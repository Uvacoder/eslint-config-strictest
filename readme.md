# `eslint-plugin-strictest`

> Exception free software through super strict ESLint rules

⚠️ The library isn't yet ready for others to use. I use it in my own repos. However, my goal is to make it available for everybody. If you interested, you can star it or write an issue.

## Why?

- Documented. Every decision for each rule is documented. For now the documentation is scattered through comments and documents. 
- No exception. I have been using this library in a production app and we have close to zero exceptions.
- Less bugs. Catching a bug with ESLint rule is extremely rare. Howerver, there are a few rules that do this very successfully.
- Modular. There are multiple rule categories — you turn on the relevant ones for you.

## Configurations

- `typescript-eslint`
- `unicorn`
- `react`
- `react-hooks`
- `promise`
- `eslint`
